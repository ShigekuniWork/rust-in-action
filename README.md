This repository contains my personal implementation and experiments based on the following resources.

## Resources
- **[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)** (The Book)
  - Used for deep diving into language specifications and core concepts like ownership and type systems.
- **[Rust in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action)** by Tim McNamara
  - Used for applying Rust to systems programming and understanding low-level implementation.
